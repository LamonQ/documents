The &amp;#34;no-cache&amp;#34; response directive indicates that the response MUST NOT be used to satisfy a subsequent request without successful validation on the origin server. This allows an origin server to prevent a cache from using it to satisfy a request without contacting it, even by caches that have been configured to send stale responses.">no-cache</a>

This directive applies to both private and shared caches. &amp;#34;MUST NOT store&amp;#34; in this context means that the cache MUST NOT intentionally store the information in non-volatile storage, and MUST make a best-effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as possible after forwarding it.">no-store</a>
